In the realm where code does dream,
Where logic flows like a gentle stream,
Lives a concept, deep and grand,
A looping dance, hand in hand.

Recursion whispers soft and clear,
"To solve the whole, the parts you'll steer.
A problem broad you'll decompose,
Into itself that same track goes."

It starts with a function, simple and neat,
That calls itself, a rhythmic beat.
Each call dives deeper, swift and true,
Till base case halts—the cycle through.

Imagine a mirror tall and wide,
Reflecting back from side to side.
Each image smaller, yet the same,
Recursion plays this mirrored game.

A classic tale of lore and fame,
Factorial’s the cherished name.
Factorial(n) calls n minus one,
Until it’s zero, then it’s done.

A fractal tree, recursive might,
Each branch splits in the moonlit night.
Branch A calls B, then B calls C,
Ever smaller, wild and free.

But beware the infinite loop,
Without an end, down you’ll swoop.
Each recursive step must tread,
Closer to its base case bed.

So in your code, with care you weave,
Recursive spells tech wizards leave.
An elegant path through nested maze,
A self-reflective, endless gaze.

In algorithms, it finds its grace,
Searching, sorting, its calm embrace.
From depths of nodes to peaks of list,
Recursion guides through logic’s mist.

Thus in the world of code’s logistics,
Recursion stands, a magic mystic.
With thoughtful plan and pure precision,
You’ll master this reflective vision.

So let your functions intertwine,
Across the recursive, grand design.
For in this dance, profound and terse,
Lies the soul of the universe.
